# CS182/282 Designing, Visualizing and Understanding Deep Neural Networks @ UC Berkeley Sp21

Self study on CS182/282 @ UC Berkeley Sp21. This repository includes solutions to the assignments. 

## Assigment 1: Neural Networks and Backprop

In this assignment you will practice writing backpropagation code, and training
Neural Networks and Convolutional Neural Networks. 

## Assigment 2: 

In this assignment you will implement recurrent networks, and apply them to image captioning on Microsoft COCO. You will also explore methods for visualizing the features of a pretrained model on ImageNet, and also this model to implement Style Transfer. 

## Assigment 3: 

In this assignment, you will learn about processing and generating text. Specifically, you will build a neural network to generate news headlines, through the training of an LSTM-based language model. Then you will train a Transformer to summarize news articles.

## Assigment 4: 

In this assigment you will use MuJoCo yto implement Imitation learning, Policy Gradients, DQN, and Actor Critic algorithms.
